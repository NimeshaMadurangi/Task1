<h2 align="center">Student Grade Tracker</h2>
<h4 align="center">This is my first task of the CodeAlpha Java Programming one month internship programme.</h4>
<br>
<p>This is simple program to tracking the student's grade. Users can add grades and display the highest, lowest and average values. I have added Scanner to get an output and ArrayList to store the grades.</p>
